# Arduino-Projects
Miscellaneous robotics projects using Arduino.


1) RTC Tube Clock:
The file consists of a Arduino code written for making a clock using Arduino Nano and a RTC tube for mainting accuracy of time.

2) Racing game:
The file contains code for a basic game consisting of a race car moving towards the finishing line by overtaking various other slower cars.
The goal is to reach as far as possible without accident to break the highscore. The game consists of various levels and can be played
on a apparatus of four push buttons and a LCD alongwith Arduino UNO.

3) Reverse Alarm:
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer to assist a driver reversing a vehicle by indicating presence of any object
behind the vehicle.

4) Speed scan:
The file contains a code to measure the speed of any object that passes by a speed gun, consisting of
two ultrasonic sensors kept at a fixed distance.
